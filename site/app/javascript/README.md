## On Bourbon

> To be legally sold as bourbon,
> the whiskey's mash bill requires a minimum of 51% corn,
> with the remainder being any cereal grain.

> The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits...states bourbon made for U.S. consumption must be:
>
> - Produced in the United States and Territories (Puerto Rico) and the District of Columbia
> - Made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn
> - Aged in new, charred oak containers
> - Distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume)
